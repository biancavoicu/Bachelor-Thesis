# PetKindness-App

Pet Kindness is a web application, which has as main objective the promotion of animal adoption, coming both to the aid of people who want a platform intended exclusively for adoption. Technologies used: Java, Spring and Spring Boot, Angular, Bootstrap, MySQL, Hibernate, Maven.
  
In terms of the user interface (UI), I preferred to maintain a simple and consistent design across all pages. When it comes to user experience (UX), I aimed to facilitate the adoption process, so it should be clear and straightforward, based on forms just a button away (with suggestive names).
  
On the back-end side, I used the Spring Web framework with the model-view-controller (MVC) architecture. To test the controllers, I used unit tests, employing the JUnit framework to write the actual tests and Mockito to simulate fictitious data and avoid external dependencies.
  
For user authentication and registration, I use Spring Security, which provides protection against various attacks, and passwords are encrypted one-way.
  
For future development directions, I've considered adding a test to discover, using artificial intelligence, which pet would be most suitable for a user.
